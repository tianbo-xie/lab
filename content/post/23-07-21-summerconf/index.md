Some research from our lab was shared at conferences this week! Prakash presented a poster at IFT FIRST in Chicago, Illinois, and Miranda presented a poster at the National ASAS Meeting in Albuquerque, New Mexico. I’ve attached some photos – I’m proud of both of you and your hard work and professionalism.
