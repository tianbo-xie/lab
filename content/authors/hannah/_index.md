Hannah joined our lab as a student research intern from September – December 2019. We loved practicing our German with her and introducing her to Lexington. Her excellent laboratory skills helped us complete cell wall analyses on several cereal materials, including intermediate wheatgrass biomass and bourbon spent grains. Since then, Hannah has completed both her master’s degree in Food Chemistry from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in Karlsruhe, Germany and the German federal food chemistry certification. She now works for Lidl International.
