She then worked for two years as a distiller at Upstate Distilling Company (Saratoga Springs, NY) before joining the Schendel lab as a master’s student.

Glenna now serves as the Distilling Education Coordinator for the James B. Beam Institute for Kentucky Spirits at the University of Kentucky. In her free time, Glenna is an Irish Dance instructor and competitor.
