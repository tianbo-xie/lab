We’re a young, energetic group! Our home base lies in the territory of food chemistry, and we place a special emphasis on the following:

· Mentoring student researchers at the undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate level

· Plant cell wall structure and structure-function implications (particularly microbial fermentation, animal feed value, and food processing characteristics)

· Structural characterization and advanced analysis (HPLC, HPAEC-PAD/MS, NMR)

· Carbohydrate chemistry and analysis

· Plant-based antioxidants

· Research that builds toward sustainable agriculture and food systems

Our home is in the [Animal&Food Sciences Department](http://afs.ca.uky.edu/) at [UKY](https://www.uky.edu/).
