abstract: ' Arabinoxylans (AXs) enter food processing and fermentation scenarios whenever grain-based ingredients are utilized. Their impacts on process efficiency and food product quality range from strongly negative to clearly beneficial, depending on both the particular food product and the AX structure. This review will focus on two structure-function relationships between AXs and fermented food production: (1) AXs’ native structure in cereal grains and structural changes that arise during production of fermented foods and (2) the impacts of AXs on processing and production of grain-based fermented foods and beverages (bread, beer, and spirits) and how variations in AX structure shift these processing impacts. Results from recently published papers have provided new insights into the connection between AXs’ structure at the molecular level and their effects on fermented food production. The purpose of this article is to review the historical progress in this area and introduce updates from recent years. Current knowledge gaps in the area are highlighted.'
